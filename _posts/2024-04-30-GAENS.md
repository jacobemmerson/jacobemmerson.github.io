a.k.a GAENS (gains!)

Oooh boy, this project was a doozy. The initial goals of this project were to create a scalable transit rerouting framework that could be feasibly applied on real transit networks subject to budgeting constraints. Common practice for transit route network design problems (TRNDPs) is to utilize evolutionary algorithms such as a genetic or ant colony algorithms; we implemented a genetic algorithm to optimize over a reweighted network where weights are determined through a MLP with equity-based inputs.

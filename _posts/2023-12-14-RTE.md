One of the first nautral language processing projects I worked on indepently. From this project, I learned basic methodologies for determining textual entailment and developing question answering systems. By no means is this SOTA, and I have since moved on to more complicated transformer and state space modeling methods; however, this project represents the beginning of my interest in NLP!

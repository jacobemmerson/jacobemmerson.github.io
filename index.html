        <h1>About</h1>
        I am a recent graduate from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sci.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a> where I earned my B.Sc. in computer science. To promote equitable applications of language models, I leverage the reasoning of LLMs to identify domain-specific problems and propose solutions under Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://ryanzshi.github.io/">Ryan Shi</a>. Additionally, I help develop models for non-invasive prenatal screening at <a target="_blank" href="https://signaturedx.com/">Signature Diagnostics</a> with Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://paulrcohen.github.io/">Paul Cohen</a>. Previously, I analyzed domain biases in attention mechanisms under Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/">Adriana Kovashka</a>.
        <br><br>
        
        I am applying to PhD programs for the Fall '25 admissions cycle to further our understanding of our increasingly complex models and how we can develop them to facilitate human-oriented goals.

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        The fields of <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> and <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b> largely encapsulate my interests; however, recently, my ideas are motivated by studies from cognitive science and linguistics. Specifically, I am interested in the behaviors that arise in generative models and how they reflect the observable mechanisms of human cognition. As both fields continue to develop, studying the parallels of humans and AI may give us greater insights on our flexible capacity for intelligence and how we can develop machines with a similar capacity. :
        <ul>
            <li><b>Idea Generation and Thought:</b> using generative models to accelerate research and propose novel solutions</li>
            <li><b>Commonsense and Reasoning:</b> determining causality and deductive reasoning</li>
            <li><b>Multimodal Learning:</b> learning representations from multiple modalities (vision, language, audio); can we learn grounded representations from the semantic associations across multiple forms of data?</li>
            <li><b>A.I. for Social Good:</b> designing models to facilitate equity-oriented goals; can we narrow the current socioeconomic disparities with AI rather than exacerbating them? </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tidbits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>While most people refer to me as Jacob, my friends like to call me Tae (you can too!). Unfortunately, I am cursed with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/decades/names2000s.html">most popular name</a> during the 2000s.</li>
            <li>I worked in the coffee industry for 3 years before starting a career in machine learning research; if you're in Pittsburgh, I recommend <a target="_blank" href = "https://commonplacecoffee.com/">Commonplace Coffee</a>!</li>

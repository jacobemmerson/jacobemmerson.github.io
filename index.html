        <h1>About</h1>
        I am a research assistant and developer interested in the fundamental limitations of artifical intelligence. I am affiliated with the <a target="_blank" href="https://zhijing-jin.com/home/">Jinesis AI Lab</a> at the Unviersity of Toronto where I work under the supervision of Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://zhijing-jin.com/home/">Zhijing Jin</a>. The cognitive disconnect between humans and machines fascinates me, especially under ambiguous contexts like morality and alignment. As we find new ways of training and tuning large models, new behavioral propensities emerge: what can we do to ensure that new models are robust and abide by human values? 
        <br><br>
        I am fortunate to have worked with Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://ryanzshi.github.io/">Ryan Shi</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/">Adriana Kovashka</a> at the University of Pittsburgh during my undergraduate studies, as well as Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://paulrcohen.github.io/">Paul Cohen</a> at <a target="_blank" href="https://signaturedx.com/">Signature Diagnostics</a>.

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        I am broadly interested in <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b>, drawing inspiration from work across fields such as <em>cognitive science</em> and <em>psychology</em>. I believe multidiscplinary research is critical to our understanding of large AI systems and their limitations. 
        Recently, my work has focused on three areas:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Perception and Multimodal Learning:</b> learning representations from multiple modalities (vision, language, audio). How can we learn grounded representations in a human-like manner? How can we distinguish between spurious correlations and valid semantic associations?</li>
            <li><b>Uncertainty Quantification:</b> quantifying the confidence and uncertainty of foundation models. Humans understand uncertainty through behavioral cues which inform our responses (e.g. Hedge phrases); can we build AI systems that similarly communicate their confidence levels in ways that are interpretable and actionable?</li>
            <li><b>Research Agents and Reasoning:</b> accelerating research with generative models, determining the causality of prior work, the capacity for analogical reasoning in deep learning models (if method X has been applied in domain A, what can this tell us about its application in domain B?)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tidbits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you're from the United States, you likely know a few people named Jacob. As the recipient of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/decades/names2000s.html">most popular name</a> in the United States during the 2000s, my friends tend to refer to me as Tae (you can too!)</li>
            <li>I worked in the coffee industry for 3 years before starting a career in machine learning research; if you're in Pittsburgh, I recommend <a target="_blank" href = "https://commonplacecoffee.com/">Commonplace Coffee</a>!</li>

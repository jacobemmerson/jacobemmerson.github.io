        <h1>About</h1>
        I am a recent graduate from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sci.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a> where I earned my B.Sc. in computer science. To promote equitable applications of language models, I leverage the reasoning capabilities of large language models to solve problems in the public sector under Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://ryanzshi.github.io/">Ryan Shi</a>. Previously, I studied perception biases and the social salience of vision-language models under Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/">Adriana Kovashka</a> and developed statistical models for non-invasive prenatal screens at <a target="_blank" href="https://signaturedx.com/">Signature Diagnostics</a> with Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://paulrcohen.github.io/">Paul Cohen</a>.

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        I am broadly interested in <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b>, drawing inspiration from work across <em>cognitive science</em> and <em>linguistics</em>. I believe multidiscplinary research is critical to our understanding of large AI systems and their fundamental limitations. 
        Recently, my work has focused on three areas:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Perception and Multimodal Learning:</b> learning representations from multiple modalities (vision, language, audio). How can we learn grounded representations in a human-like manner? How can we distinguish between spurious correlations and valid semantic associations?</li>
            <li><b>Uncertainty Quantification:</b> quantifying the confidence and uncertainty of foundation models. Humans understand uncertainty through behavioral cues which inform our responses (e.g. Hedge phrases); can we build AI systems that similarly communicate their confidence levels in ways that are interpretable and actionable?</li>
            <li><b>Research Agents and Reasoning:</b> accelerating research with generative models, determining the causality of prior work, the capacity for analogical reasoning in deep learning models (if method X has been applied in domain A, what can this tell us about its application in domain B?)</li>
        </ul>
        As AI continues to improve and exhibit increasingly human-like behaviors, can these behaviors provide us with insights about our capabilities? How do the behaviors they exhibit reflect societal beliefs?

        <h2>Tidbits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>While most people refer to me as Jacob, my friends like to call me Tae (you can too!). Unfortunately, I am cursed with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/decades/names2000s.html">most popular name</a> during the 2000s.</li>
            <li>I worked in the coffee industry for 3 years before starting a career in machine learning research; if you're in Pittsburgh, I recommend <a target="_blank" href = "https://commonplacecoffee.com/">Commonplace Coffee</a>!</li>

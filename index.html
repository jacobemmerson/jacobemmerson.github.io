        <h1>About</h1>
        I am a recent graduate from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sci.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a> where I earned my B.Sc. in computer science and a minor in applied statistics. During the Fall '24 semester, I will be applying to PhD programs to pursue a research-oriented career in AI/ML.
        <br><br>
        At Pitt, I am a research assistant for Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/">Adriana Kovashka</a> and Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://ryanzshi.github.io/">Ryan Shi</a> (separate labs). Additionally, I help develop non-invasive prenatal screening techniques at <a target="_blank" href="https://signaturedx.com/">Signature Diagnostics</a>, a Pittsburgh-based biotech startup.

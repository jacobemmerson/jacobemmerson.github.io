        <h1>About</h1>
        I am a recent graduate from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sci.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a> where I earned my B.Sc. in computer science. To promote equitable applications of language models, I leverage the reasoning capabilities of large language models to solve problems in the public sector under Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://ryanzshi.github.io/">Ryan Shi</a>. Additionally, I help develop models for non-invasive prenatal screening at <a target="_blank" href="https://signaturedx.com/">Signature Diagnostics</a> with Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://paulrcohen.github.io/">Paul Cohen</a>. Previously, I analyzed cultural biases in vision-language models under Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/">Adriana Kovashka</a>.

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> and <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b> largely encapsulate my interests, drawing inspiration from <em>cognitive science</em> and <em>linguistics</em>. Interdiscplinary research lies the foundation for much of my work and, in my mind, is critical to understanding our models and their limitations. 
        From an AI perspective, my interests include:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Multimodal Learning:</b> learning representations from multiple modalities (vision, language, audio). How can we learn grounded representations in a human-like manner? How can we distinguish between spurious correlations and valid semantic associations?</li>
            <li><b>Ideas Generation and Reasoning:</b> using generative models to accelerate research, determining the causality of prior work, and the capacity for reasoning &#8212; analogical reasoning in particular &#8212; in deep learning models.</li>
            <li><b>AI for Social Good:</b> designing models to facilitate equity-oriented goals. Can we narrow the current socioeconomic disparities with AI rather than exacerbating them?</li>
        </ul>
        Despite their inherent limitations and lack of interpretability, machines are, in some sense, much more malleable than the human brain. As we try to replicate human-level capabilities in these models, what can we learn about our cognition? To this end, I am interested in the behaviors exhibited by generative models and how they parallel mechanisms of human cognition.

        <ul>
            <li>While most people refer to me as Jacob, my friends like to call me Tae (you can too!). Unfortunately, I am cursed with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/decades/names2000s.html">most popular name</a> during the 2000s.</li>
            <li>I worked in the coffee industry for 3 years before starting a career in machine learning research; if you're in Pittsburgh, I recommend <a target="_blank" href = "https://commonplacecoffee.com/">Commonplace Coffee</a>!</li>

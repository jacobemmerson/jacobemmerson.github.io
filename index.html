        <h1>About</h1>
        I am a recent graduate from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sci.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a> where I earned my B.Sc. in computer science. To promote equitable applications of language models, I leverage the reasoning of LLMs to identify domain-specific problems and propose solutions under Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://ryanzshi.github.io/">Ryan Shi</a>. Additionally, I help develop models for non-invasive prenatal screening at <a target="_blank" href="https://signaturedx.com/">Signature Diagnostics</a> with Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://paulrcohen.github.io/">Paul Cohen</a>. Previously, I analyzed domain biases in attention mechanisms under Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/">Adriana Kovashka</a>.
        <br><br>
        
        I am applying to PhD programs for the Fall '25 admissions cycle to further our understanding of our increasingly complex models and how we can develop them to facilitate human-oriented goals. Feel free to reach out with any questions relating to my previous work or current interests.

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        My research interests primarily fall under the fields of <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> and <b>Machine Learning</b>. With the rapid developments in both fields and a plethora of problems, I seemingly find new interests everyday. However, these topics have remained concrete over the past year:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Multimodal Machine Learning:</b> Are latent representations shared between modalities transferrable and robust to domain shifts? How can we design vision-grounded concepts such that they are compositional in nature?</li>
            <li><b>Commonsense and Reasoning:</b> Determining causality, deductive reasoning, decomposing complex problems; How can we design neuro-symbolic architectures to become more self-supervised?</li>
            <li><b>A.I. for Social Good:</b> Are our models equitable? How do modern AI methods affect the global digital divide, and how can we narrow the disparities in information literacy with AI?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tidbits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>While most people refer to me as Jacob, my friends like to call me Tae (you can too!). Unfortunately, I am cursed with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/decades/names2000s.html">most popular name</a> during the 2000s.</li>
            <li>I worked in the coffee industry for 3 years before starting a career in machine learning research; if you're in Pittsburgh, I recommend <a target="_blank" href = "https://commonplacecoffee.com/">Commonplace Coffee</a>!</li>
            <li>During the pandemic, I made a very last minute decision to pivot and pursue a computer science degree over (cognitive) neuroscience. Why? I didn't want a PhD... but... well...</li>
